# Tempus: Reconstructing Precision Medicine with Artifical Intelligence

## Overview and Origin

**Name:** Tempus  

**Incorporation Date:** 2015  

**Founders:** Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell  

**Origin and Idea:** Tempus was founded in August of 2015 by Eric Lefkofsky, after his wife was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Shortly after he founded the company in an effort to bring the power of technology and artificial intelligence to cancer care. Tempus was founded to collect, structure, and analyze clinical and molecular data to enable personalized treatment plans for cancer patients.

**Funding:** Tempus has raised over $1.3 billion in funding from investors such as NEA, Revolution Growth, and T. Rowe Price.

## Business Activities

**Problem Statement:** Tempus is focused on building the first version of a platform capable of ingesting real time healthcare data in an effort to personalize diagnostics.

**Target Audience:** The company primarily serves healthcare providers, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies. The target market includes oncology, infectious diseases, and cardiology sectors, which represent multi-billion-dollar markets.

**USP:** Tempusâ€™ unique advantage lies in its ability to integrate clinical and molecular data at scale, providing insights that other platforms cannot match. This allows for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the individual genetic makeup of each patient. This is something that many pharmaceutical companies do not do or do not have the structure to do so.

**Technologies in Use:** Tempus uses technologies like machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and cloud computing. They employ NLP to extract insights from unstructured clinical notes and machine learning models to predict patient outcomes.

## Landscape

**Field Overview:** Tempus operates in the AI-driven precision medicine field, particularly in oncology and genomics.

**Trends:** Over the last decade, there has been a significant trend towards personalized medicine. Innovations include AI-powered diagnostics, genomics sequencing, and integration of big data in healthcare. Companies are increasingly using AI to analyze complex biological data and predict treatment outcomes.

**Competitors:** Major competitors include Flatiron Health, Foundation Medicine, and IBM Watson Health.

## Results

**Impact:** Tempus has partnered with over 400 academic institutions and hospitals, analyzing data from over 5 million patients. This has significantly improved patient outcomes by enabling more precise treatment strategies.

**Success Metrics:** In the AI-driven precision medicine field, core metrics include patient outcomes, data accuracy, and partnership growth. Tempus has shown strong performance, with data accuracy rates exceeding 90% and a steady increase in healthcare partnerships.

**Competitive Performance:** Compared to its competitors, Tempus has a more comprehensive data integration approach, making it a leader in the precision medicine space. Its rapid growth and significant funding underscore its competitive edge.

## Recommendations

**New Service:** I recommend that Tempus explore expanding its AI capabilities to include predictive analytics for preventive healthcare. This service could help identify at-risk patients before they develop severe conditions, enabling early intervention.

**Rationale:** Preventive healthcare is a growing field, and integrating predictive analytics could open new revenue streams for Tempus, while also improving patient outcomes.

**Technology Utilization:** This service would require advanced machine learning models trained on large datasets to predict disease onset. Utilizing cloud computing for scalability and secure data management would also be essential.
